Hey there!

My name is Kashish Kanodia, and I'm a sophomore at IIT Guwahati. To tell you a little about myself, I'm a hardworking, selectively extroverted, passionate, and perseverant individual currently exploring the programming domain. I'm currently learning C++ and OOPs and plan to master them soon.

Apart from programming, I enjoy traveling, dancing, sports, and writing.
